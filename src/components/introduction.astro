    A (Junior) Software Engineer
  </h1>
  <h2>
    Hi there, the name's Fauzan Rizky Naufal. But you can just call me Ojan, 
    i'm a highschool student in Indonesia. And since i was a kid, i am super interested in learning about computers and the internet.
    From simple scripts to web scrapings, Python is my main language. Aside from the world of programming, i usually unwind myself with playing videogames. 
    Both videogames and programming have been my favorite things since i was a child, they have a special place in my heart that i will never forget
